# FidoU2F
The implementation of FidoU2F was based on [U2FToken](https://github.com/fightyz/U2FToken) and  [ledger-u2f-javacard>](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-u2f-javacard).
This applet has been tested with [JC30M48](http://www.javacardos.com/store/java_jcop_jc30m48cr_card.php).
You can open view code in [JCIDE](http://www.javacardos.com/tools).We have created a project file(FidoU2F.jcproj) for the users of JCIDE.
